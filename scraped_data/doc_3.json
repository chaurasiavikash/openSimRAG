Therefore, this site contains documentation for protected methods that you might need to implement. If you simply want to make use of the API in MATLAB or Python, then this documentation contains excessive information and you should check out the user API documentation. The table below represents the hierarchical structure of OpenSim.\nEach box represents a class utilized by the OpenSim API, and is built on top of\n(i.e., requires) the components underneath. \nFor example, you can click on the \"Model Component\" block to see a list of\nmodel components, such as body, constraint, or joint. Click on any of the boxes to navigate to corresponding class description.
