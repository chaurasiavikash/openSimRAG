This collection is no longer being maintained through this project. To find OpenSim motion and simulation data, you can conduct a search on SimTK. Go to https://simtk.org/search/search.php?srch=neuromuscular&type_of_search=soft and then narrow your search to \"data sets\" by checking the box on the left. ---------------------------------- A repository of motion data from experiments and simulations, contributed by members of the OpenSim community. Please respect your fellow OpenSim Users. In using these data we ask that you respect the hard work of your fellow researchers by citing their work appropriately. When you go to the Download section you will be directed to individual project pages for each model which contain all of the files and documentation. Please carefully review the publications and cite the references in your future papers, presentations, grant applications, etc. Have data to contribute? Do you have simulation or motion data which you would like to make available through this library? Providing others with access to your data can stimulate future studies, provide a foundation for young researchers, and maximize the impact of your work. Itâ€™s easy to set up a project page to post your work. This will allow you to track who is using your data and be in contact with them. Please consider contributing! If you would like to have your project included on this site, please contact Jennifer Hicks, listed as one of the Project Leads. No guarantees about quality, correctness or support are provided by the SimTK team or OpenSim team. Use at your own risk.
