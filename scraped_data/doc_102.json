Download Latest Releases Saccade Simulator: SaccadeSimulator.zip License: Saccade Simulator NoTremor aims to provide patient specific computational models of the coupled brain and neuromuscular systems that will be subsequently used to improve the quality of analysis, prediction and progression of Parkinsonâ€™s disease. In particular, it aspires to establish the neglected link between brain modelling and neuromuscular systems that will result in a holistic representation of the physiology for PD patients. 124 downloads 2 forum posts 6 followers Last updated Sep 4, 2017 Project Statistics Join Mailing Lists Suggest Idea Chris Papapavlou Dimitar Stanev Konstantinos Moustakas People also viewed Evaluation of In Vivo Knee Load Predictions Using...
