More... Detailed Description An abstract class for representing a function. A function is a relation between independent variables and a dependent value such that for any particular set of independent variables there is only one unique dependent value. Values of the function and its derivatives are obtained by calling the calcValue() method. The curve may or may not be finite or differentiable; the calcValue() method returns values between - SimTK::Infinity and SimTK::Infinity , or it returns SimTK::NaN (not a number) if the curve is not defined. Currently, functions of up to 3 variables (x,y,z) are supported. Author Frank C. Anderson Member Typedef Documentation ◆ Self typedef Function OpenSim::Function::Self This typedef might be useful within the member functions of this class. This is generated by the OpenSim_DECLARE_*_OBJECT macros. ◆ Super typedef Object OpenSim::Function::Super Use this typedef to refer to the superclass of this class. Avoid using the explicit type name of the superclass; this would introduce bugs if the superclass is changed. This is generated by the OpenSim_DECLARE_*_OBJECT macros.

Exceptions Exception if the argument is not of type Function . ◆ calcDerivative() virtual double OpenSim::Function::calcDerivative ( const std::vector< int > & derivComponents , const SimTK::Vector & x ) const virtual Calculate a partial derivative of this function at a particular point. Which derivative to take is specified by listing the input components with which to take it. For example, if derivComponents=={0}, that indicates a first derivative with respective to component 0. If derivComponents=={0, 0, 0}, that indicates a third derivative with respective to component 0. If derivComponents=={4, 7}, that indicates a partial second derivative with respect to components 4 and 7. Parameters derivComponents the input components with respect to which the derivative should be taken. Its size must be less than or equal to the value returned by getMaxDerivativeOrder() . x the Vector of input arguments. Its size must equal the value returned by getArgumentSize() .

It is up to the caller to delete the returned object when no longer needed. Every concrete object deriving from Object implements this pure virtual method automatically, via the declaration macro it invokes (e.g., OpenSim_DECLARE_CONCRETE_OBJECT() ). Note that the concrete class overrides modify the return type to be a pointer to the concrete object; that still overrides the base class method because the return type is covariant with (that is, derives from) Object.
