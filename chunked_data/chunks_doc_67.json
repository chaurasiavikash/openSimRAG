The library is no longer being maintained through this project. To find OpenSim models, you now have two options: 1) Visit the summary table on the OpenSim documentation pages ( http://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8080/display/OpenSim/Musculoskeletal+Models ) 2) Conduct a search on SimTK. Click here ( https://simtk.org/search/search.php?srch=opensim&type_of_search=soft ) and then narrow your search to \"models\" by checking the box on the left. ------------------------------------------ Welcome to the neuromuscular models library! The goal of this site is to provide a resource for students, researchers, and clinicians to access, use, test, and develop models. The majority of models in this library are for use with OpenSIM (which you can download free through simtk.org) and/or SIMM. Please take a look and enjoy. Please respect your fellow modelers. In using these models we ask that you respect the hard work of your fellow researchers by citing their work appropriately. When you go to the Download section you will be directed to individual project pages for each model which contain all of the files and documentation. Please carefully review the publications and cite the references in your future papers, presentations, grant applications, etc. Have a model to contribute? Do you have a model which you would like to make available through this library? Providing others with access to your models can stimulate future studies, provide a foundation for young researchers, and maximize the impact of your model. Itâ€™s easy to set up a project page to post your model. This will allow you to track who is using your model and be in contact with them. Please consider contributing! The project administrators can help you post your model, so please contact us if you would like to get started. 6 forum posts 5 followers Last updated May 4, 2016 Project Statistics Katherine Steele People also viewed Musculoskeletal Model of the NZW Rabbit Hindlimb Neuromusculoskeletal Modeling (NMSM) Pipeline An OpenSim plugin to minimize joint reaction forces and...
