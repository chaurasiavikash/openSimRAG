Also included are all analysis, real-time muscle deformation tracking, and display code. The OpenArm Multisensor 1.0 data set contains time series cross-sectional ultrasound scans of the brachioradialis muscle under variable elbow loading, alongside corresponding surface electromyography (sEMG), acoustic myography (AMG), and force data. The OpenArm 1.0 and 2.0 data sets encompass factorial sets of volumetric scans of the arm, generated using ultrasound and motion capture, that allow for analysis of both force- and configuration-associated muscle deformation. We invite anyone in the research community to use the OpenArm and OpenArm Multisensor data sets to validate existing muscle deformation models or to devise new ones.
