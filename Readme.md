# OpenSim RAG Project Summary

## Project Overview

This project created a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for OpenSim documentation, enabling users to ask questions about OpenSim and receive accurate, context-specific answers based on official documentation.

## Development Journey

### Phase 1: Documentation Collection
- Created a web crawler to extract OpenSim documentation
- Implemented content processing and cleaning
- Developed a chunking system to break content into appropriate segments
- Built a vector database system using ChromaDB

### Phase 2: RAG Implementation
- Started with a simple T5-based RAG system
- Encountered issues with model quality and responses
- Upgraded to larger models (Zephyr-7B) for better response quality
- Discovered and fixed an empty vector database issue
- Created a synthetic knowledge base with essential OpenSim information
- Addressed negative similarity score issues with a simplified retrieval approach

## Current System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Knowledge Base**
   - ChromaDB vector database
   - HuggingFace embeddings (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
   - Custom-curated OpenSim documentation

2. **Retrieval System**
   - Direct similarity-based document retrieval
   - Top-k document selection without threshold filtering

3. **Generation System**
   - Zephyr-7B language model (HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta)
   - 4-bit quantization for memory efficiency
   - Context-sensitive prompt templates

## Key Files

- `fixed_rag.py`: The main RAG system implementation
- `create_opensim_db.py`: Knowledge base creation script
- `test_database.py`: Script to verify database content and retrieval

## Usage

The system supports both interactive and single-question modes:

```bash
# Interactive mode
python fixed_rag.py

# Single question mode
python fixed_rag.py --question "How do markers work in OpenSim?"
```

## Sample Topics Covered

The knowledge base includes information about:
1. OpenSim overview and installation
2. Models and their components
3. Markers and motion capture
4. Inverse kinematics and forward dynamics
5. Python API and file formats

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Knowledge Base Expansion**
   - Add more detailed documentation on specific topics
   - Include troubleshooting information
   - Add tutorials and examples

2. **Model Improvements**
   - Explore fine-tuning on OpenSim-specific content
   - Consider OpenAI API integration for higher quality responses
   - Implement hybrid retrieval (keyword + semantic)

3. **Interface Enhancements**
   - Develop web interface for easier access
   - Add visualization of retrieved document contexts
   - Implement history tracking for conversations

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a functional RAG system for OpenSim documentation. While there were challenges with vector database creation and similarity scoring, these were addressed through direct retrieval mechanisms and synthetic data. The system now provides useful responses to a wide range of OpenSim-related queries using the Zephyr-7B language model.
